.SH NAME
hspell \- Hebrew spellchecker
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hspell
[
.B \-vcnsa
]
.BI [\| file\|.\|.\|. \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hspell
tries to find incorrectly spelled Hebrew words in its input files.
.PP
Like the traditional Unix spell(1),
.B hspell
outputs the sorted list of incorrect words, and does not (yet) have a more
friendly interface for making these corrections for you. However, unlike
spell(1),
.B hspell
can suggest possible corrections for some spelling errors - such suggestions
are enabled with the
.B \-c
(correct) and
.B \-n
(notes) options.
.PP
.B
Hspell
currently expects ISO-8859-8-encoded input files. Non-Hebrew characters in the
input files are ignored, allowing the easy spellingchecking of Hebrew-English 
texts, as well as HTML or TeX files.
If files using a different encoding (e.g., UTF8) are to be checked, they must
be converted first to ISO-8859-8 (e.g., see iconv(1), recode(1)).
.PP
The output will also be in ISO-8859-8 encoding, in so-called "logical order",
so it is normally useful to pipe it to bidiv(1) before viewing, as in:
.PP
.RS
.B "hspell -c filename | bidiv | less"
.RE
.PP
If no input file is given,
.B hspell
reads from its standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c 
If the
.B \-c
option is given,
.B hspell
will suggest corrections for misspelled words, whenever it can find such
corrections. The correction mechanism in this release is especially good
at finding corrections for incorrect niqqud-less spellings, with missing
or extra 'immot-qri'a.
.TP
.B \-n 
The
.B \-n
option will give some longer "notes" about certain spelling errors, explaining
why these are indeed errors (or in what cases using this word is in fact
correct). It is recommend to combine the two options,
.B \-cn
for maximal correction help from
.BR hspell .
.TP
.B \-v
The
.B \-v
(verbose) option will explain for each
.I correct
word why it was
recognized (show the basic noun, verb, etc., that this inflection relates to).
NOTE: In this version, this option will not work correctly if
.BR hspell 's
dictionaries were installed in compressed form.
.TP
.B \-s
Normally, the words deemed spelling mistakes are shown in alphabetical order.
The
.B \-s
option orders them by
.IR severity ,
i.e., the errors that most frequently appear in the document are shown first.
This option is most useful for people helping to build
.BR hspell 's
word list, and are looking for common correct words that
.B hspell
does not know yet.
.TP
.B \-a 
With the 
.B -a
option, 
.B hspell
tries to emulate (as little as possible of) 
.B ispell's
pipe interface. This allows
.B lyx
to use
.B hspell
as an external spell-checker, if the lines
.B "\\\\spell_command hspell-i"
and
.B "\\\\use_pspell false"
appear in ~/.lyx/lyxrc.
.TP
.B \-d \-B and \-m
These three options are passed to 
.B hspell 
by
.B lyx
and are cordially ignored.

.SH "SPELLING STANDARD"
Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with the official
niqqud-less spelling rules ("Ha-ktiv Khasar Ha-niqqud", colloquially known as
"Ktiv Male") published by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.

This is both an
advantage and a disadvantage, depending on your viewpoint.
It's an advantage
because it encourages a
.B correct
and consistent spelling style throughout
your writing. It is a disadvantage, because a few of the Academia's official
spelling decisions are relatively unknown to the general public.

Users of Hspell (and all Hebrew writers, for that matter) are encouraged to 
read the Academia's official niqqud-less spelling rules (which are printed at
the end of most modern Hebrew dictionaries), and to refer to Hebrew
dictionaries which use the niqqud-less spelling (such as Millon Ha-hove or
Rav Milim).

Future releases might include an option for alternative spelling standards.
.SH "BEHIND THE SCENES"
The
.B hspell
program itself is a relatively-simple Perl script, but the real
"brains" behind it are the word lists (dictionary) provided by the Hspell project.

In order for this dictionary to be completely free of other people's copyright
restrictions, the Hspell project is a clean-room implementation, not based on
other companies' word lists, on other companies' spell checkers, or on copying
of printed dictionaries.

The word list is also not based on automatic scanning
of available Hebrew documents (such as online newspapers), because there is
no way to guarantee that such a list will be correct (and not contain
misspellings, useless proper names, slang, and so on), complete (certain
inflections might not appear in the chosen samples) or consistent (especially
when it comes to niqqud-less spelling rules).

Instead, our idea was to write programs which know how to correctly inflect
Hebrew nouns and conjugate Hebrew verbs. The input to these programs is a
list of noun stems and verb roots, plus hints needed for the correct
inflection when these cannot be figured out automatically. These input files
are obviously an important part of the Hspell project. The "word list
generators" (written in Perl, and are also part of the Hspell project) then
create the complete word-list for use by the spellchecking program, hspell.
This generation process is only done once, when installing
.BR hspell .

The generated lists are useful for much more than spellchecking - see the
Hspell project's README file for more ideas for the future.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
~/.hspell_words, ./hspell_words
These files, if they exist, should contain a list of Hebrew words that
.B hspell
will also accept as correct words.

.SH "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"
The hspell utility and the linguistic databases behind it (collectively called
"the Hspell project") were created by Nadav Har'El <nyh@math.technion.ac.il>
and by Dan Kenigsberg <danken@cs.technion.ac.il>.

Although we wrote all of Hspell's code ourselves, we are truly indebted to
the old-style "open source" pioneers - people who wrote books instead of
hiding their knowledge in proprietary software. For the correct noun
inflections, Dr. Shaul Barkali's "The Complete Noun Book" has been a great
help. Prof. Uzzi Ornan's booklet "Verb Conjugation in Flow Charts" has been
instrumental in the implementation of verb conjugation, and Barkali's
"The Complete Verb Book" was used too.

During our work we have extensively used a number of Hebrew dictionaries,
including Even Shoshan, Millon Ha-hove and Rav-Milim, to ensure the correctness
of certain words. Various Hebrew newspapers and books, both printed and online,
were used for inspiration and for finding words we still do not recognize.

We wish to thank Cilla Tuviana and Dr. Zvi Har'El for their assistance with
some grammatical questions.

Several other people helped us in various releases, with suggestions, fixes
or patches - they are listed in the WHATSNEW file in the distribution.

.SH "BUGS"
This manual page is in English.
.PP
The
.B hspell
spellchecker depends on word lists created by the Hspell project. At this
stage, these word lists still do not cover all (or even most) of the Hebrew
vocabulary, and so
.B hspell
will often list correct words (that it doesn't know) as being wrong. This
is being worked on, and
.BR hspell 's
vocabulary will grow from release to release.
.PP
.B hspell
currently allows any of Hebrew's particles (prefixes like he, bet, vav, etc.)
to precede any of the correct words. In some cases this makes absurd words
accepted as correct (e.g., preceding the imperative form of a verb by he,
or lamed before a conjugated verb), and it is even stranger when
.B hspell
offers such monstrosities as corrections.

Kinuyim Khavurim (possesive suffixes) are recognized for nouns and infinitives,
but not yet for other verb forms.

For GUI-lovers,
.BR hspell 's
user interface is an abomination. In the future, a better C version will be
written that will also be able to interface with other programs.
