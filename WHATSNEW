Release 0.8 (June 21, 2004):

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: almost
   2,000 base words added.

 * Reorganized and simplified directory structure of source distribution,
   and added "autoconf" configuration (use "configure" before "make").

   See "configure --help" for a list of build-time options, such as to enable
   more verb forms and to enable a morphological analyzer for the "-l" option.
   See the INSTALL file for more instructions.

   The old Perl "hspell.pl", deprecated in release 0.6, is now gone.

 * If available, use zlib instead of an external gzip process to read the
   compressed dictionaries. On our tests, this reduced startup time 2-6 fold.
   It also allows the Hspell API to be used on systens where pipes or
   gzip are not available, but zlib is (namely, Windows).

 * Improved Hspell's C api. There is a new function hspell_uninit() for
   reclaiming memory allocated by hspell_init(), and all exit() calls
   were purged from the Library (printouts are still there, unfortunately).

   NOTE: Because Hspell now uses zlib (see above), when using the libhspell.a
   library you must now also link with the zlib (-lz) library. This is
   especially important to remember when looking for libhspell in your own
   configure scripts.

 * Fixed a few bugs: in morphological analyzer, handling of files without
   a newline, and more.

 * It is now possible to use Hspell's Hebrew word list (and valid prefix
   information) in the upcoming versions of the Aspell spell-checker.
   A new build option, "configure --enable-aspell", creates the two files
   "he.cwl" and "he_affix.dat" which can then be used to build Aspell's
   Hebrew dictionary.

   We would like to thank Kevin Atkinson and Kevin Patrick Scannell for
   their efforts in fixing Aspell's affix support, and making Aspell a
   viable multi-lingual spell-checker.

 * Vocabulary: 425,709 words (when including kinuyim on verbs)
               based on 8935 nouns, 2181 adjectives, 5192 verb stems, and
	       2289 other words


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.7 (December 22, 2003):

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   1,000 base words added.

 * Portability improvements (thanks to Baruch Even).

 * New run-time option -H causes hspell to accept He Ha-she'ela in the text.

 * The "-n" option (for spelling hints, an explanation of certain kinds of
   errors) that was lost in version 0.6, is now back. The "likelyerrors"
   feature is still missing in this version.

 * A new, and somewhat tentative, Documented C API (libhspell.a library,
   spell.h header, hspell.3 manual). This are not available in the normal
   RPM - compile the sources yourself if you want them.

 * A full morphological analyzer (explaining all the possible ways to read
   a given word, how each reading was derived and its syntactic properties)
   is now available when Hspell is run with the "-l" option.

   Because the data files needed for this feature currently take up as much
   as 4 times the space needed only for spell-checking, and because the
   collection and sorting of linguistic information makes the compilation
   takes much longer, this feature is not compiled by default, unless
   compilation is done with "make linginfo". Also, the normal RPM does not
   include this feature, but the "fat" RPM does include it.
   An innovative parade of hash symbols now appears on screen to the benefit
   of the bored builder :)

 * Vocabulary: 406,629 words (when including kinuyim on verbs)
               based on 8042 nouns, 1783 adjectives, 5113 verb stems, and
	       1880 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.6 (August 5, 2003):

 In this release, the Hspell front-end (the hspell program) was rewritten.
 The new front-end has many improvements over the old one, but also a few
 setbacks - features that are (temporarily) unavailable because they weren't
 yet ported to the new version.

 The improvements:

 * A huge performance improvement - hspell now starts up, and runs, at least
   20 times faster than it used to and takes less than one fifth the memory.

 * The new front-end is written in C, so Hspell can now run on systems which
   do not have Perl. Perl is still needed for building Hspell from source.

 * The list of allowed prefixes was improved (joined work with Shlomo Yona)
   and hspell now finally knows which prefixes are valid for most words,
   reducing the risk of accepting misspellings as correct and reducing the
   number of silly (and wrong) correction suggestions.

   Note that unlike earlier versions, words listed in the user's personal
   dictionary (~/.hspell_words or ./hspell_words) are no longer automatically
   accepted with prefixes. Also, these words are never used as suggested
   corrections.


 * "hspell -a" was made more compatible with the standard "ispell -a" (thanks
   to Mooffie). Hspell is now known to be used with LyX, KDE, Geresh and Emacs.
   
 The setbacks:

 * The "-v" option, that used to explain how valid words were derived, is
   no longer available in this version. It is replaced by a "-l" option,
   which in this release is weaker (it can only show a division of valid
   words into prefix particle + word).

 * The "-n" option, that used to give hints on how to spell correctly, is
   not available.

 * The "likelyerrors" feature (or recognizing certain words as theoretically
   correct but still very likely to be mistakes) is not available.

 * TeX-like repeated single quote ('') is not treated as double quotes (").

 * Long options (GNU's "minus-minus" options) are not supported in this
   version.

 Some other changes:

 * Included in the distribution is a new utility "multispell" by Mooffie,
   which can spell-check mixed Hebrew-English text by interfacing with two
   spell-checkers (hspell and ispell) simultaneously. Multispell is better
   than hspell's built-in slave mode (hspell -a -i) when the calling program
   can't deal with wrong word order in the results (e.g., Emacs has this
   issue.)

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and more words added: over 600
   base words added.

 * Vocabulary: 394,833 words (when including kinuyim on verbs)
               based on 7462 nouns, 1533 adjectives, 5060 verb stems, and
	       1819 other words


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.5: (May 8, 2003)
 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: about
   2,000 base words added.

 * Objective Kinuim are now allowed on all forms of verbs. Because this adds
   as many as 150,000 correct but rarely-used (in modern texts) inflections,
   a compile-time option is present for enabling or disabling these forms.
   The default in this version is *not* to enable them, but this may be changed
   in the future. 
   Also, precompiled RPMs of both types are available (thanks to Tzafrir Cohen).
   In order to build the source rpm you must --define in the command-line either
   'fat 0' or 'fat 1'. Can anyone tell me how can I set a default for that?

 * Infinitives now allow בכלמ prefixes, not just ל: לשבור, בשבור, כשבור, משבור.
 
 * Added a "-d" option to the word-list generators, which prints derivation
   explanation for all inflections, and also gender information for all nouns. 
   This feature is not presently used for spell-checking.

 * Bug fixes: B-words were ignored unless "-v" was used; gimatria checking
   failed to recognize numbers ending in 17-19; 

 * fixed "ispell -a"'s handling of "^..." lines that prevented Hspell from
   working properly with KDE (thanks to Meni Livne).

 * Vocabulary: 390,846 words (when including kinuyim on verbs)
               based on 7125 nouns, 1484 adjectives, 4801 verb stems, and
	       1799 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.4: (March 10, 2003)

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   2,300 base words and 60,000 inflections.
   Thanks to Orna Agmon for reporting some of the missing words.

 * Complete overhaul of the hspell homepage
   (http://www.ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker/).
   Also, the site now features signed RPMs, and the spec used to make them
   is included in the source distribution. The current binary RPM includes the
   dictionary compressed with a special algorithm, making it, and the final
   installation, very small (as little as 100K), at the expense of the "-v"
   option not working.
   Thanks to Tzafrir Cohen and Oron Peled for the initial version of the spec.

 * Shem Poal Natuy + Kinuy for all verbs, things like: ותבשב ,יננטצהב
   There is probably an error in the conjugation of these Shmot Poal from Binyan
   Qal. woo creates בזוכרנו, while the strict rules say it should be בזכרנו.
   This would be settled by the next release.

 * Added "-i" option, to be used in addition to "-a" from within other
   programs (e.g. LyX) to allow spell-checking of mixed English-Hebrew text
   by using ispell for the English words. The new program "hspell-i" runs
   hspell with the -i option, so it can be used in (for example) LyX as
   the spellchecker. (thanks to Alon Altman)

 * Long options, and new --help and --version options. (thanks to Tzafrir Cohen)

 * Vocabulary: 250,027 words
               based on 6238 nouns, 1174 adjectives, 4584 verb stems, and
	       1291 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.3: (February 2, 2003)

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   1,000 base words and 20,000 inflections. In this release, emphasis has
   been put on adding Hebrew nouns and adjectives.

 * Fixed Makefile behavior in certain case. In particular "make" should work
   regardless of LC_* environment variables. However, as hspell currently
   works on iso8859-8 encoded files, users with a utf8 locale must run the
   "hspell" perl program as "LC_ALL=C hspell" (otherwise, they will see
   error messages from Perl).

 * Added ispell-like "-a" option, for interfacing with LyX.
   If you want to use hspell under LyX you should use Hebrew-enabled LyX
   (version 1.1.6fix4 is known to work). Add the following line to your
   .lyx/lyxrc file:
	\spell_command hspell
   Notice that this prevents using English ispell/aspell from within LyX. 
   If you know of a better configuration, please tell us.
   Notice that if a Hebrew misspelled word is found, it is shown reversed on
   LyX's spellchecker (and so are its corrections). This is about to be
   corrected in future releases of LyX. Also, LyX breaks Hebrew acronyms
   wrongly, and causes hspell to reject them.

   Read http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~dekelts/lyx/instructions2.html for
   Hebrew LyX general instructions.

 * No longer incorrectly recognize שלווום (should be שלוום, "that to their
   hook").

 * The wolig.pl automatic inflector can handle country names, and many more
   country names and nationalities have been added. Note that since I did
   not find a source for "official" country-name spellings in Hebrew, our
   list might contain errors. Please tell us if you know a dictionary or other
   authoritative document which contains the official Hebrew spellings of
   country names.

 * Vocabulary: 189,347 words
               based on 5238 nouns, 927 adjectives, 3568 verb stems, and
	       1203 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.2: (January 5, 2003)
 * Many more nouns, verbs, and other words: around 2500 new base words, and
   40,000 inflections. Emphasis has been given to adding *common* words that
   will appear in typical, modern, documents.
 * Several incorrect words purged or fixed.
 * Wolig.pl (noun inflector) overhaul to better and more consistently handle
   niqqud-less (ktiv male) spelling rules, and to be able to theoretically
   handle at least 99.9% of the Hebrew nouns (of course, we don't have all of
   them in the dictionary, yet :)).
 * -n option to hspell program, which gives longer (human-written) explanations
   on certain spelling errors - especially common niqqud-less spelling errors.
 * Read additional accepted words from ~/.hspell_words and/or ./hspell_words
 * Kinuim Khavurim (possesive suffixes) are recognized on the infinitive forms
   of the verb.
 * Added manual page, hspell(1)
 * Improved Makefile (thanks to Oron Peled) and made other changes to the
   distribution (thanks to Baruch Even) for more easily building binary
   packages of hspell.

 * Vocabulary: 169,266 words
               based on 4505 nouns, 645 adjectives, 3407 verb stems, and
	       1237 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.1: (first public release - December 13, 2002)

 * Vocabulary: 125,022 words
               based on 3206 nouns, 452 adjectives, 2712 verb stems, and
	       980 other words

 * In this release we would like to thank Uwe Brauer and Michael Lugassy for
   "convincing" us to start and to advance this project when we were almost
   ready to give up.
